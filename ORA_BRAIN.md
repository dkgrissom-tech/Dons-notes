## 2. Apple Developer Credentials

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Apple ID** | dkgrissom@gmail.com |
| **Team ID** | `7L4H4W3H94` |
| **App Store Connect API Key ID** | `N8C8H25PK2` |
| **Issuer ID** | `872fbdda-59aa-4746-8d08-e6c566d1f8f9` |
| **Private Key (ES256 DER base64)** | `[PRIVATE_KEY — stored in GitHub Secret APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY]` |
| **Internal TestFlight group ID** | `aca5f162-a25f-4d25-ba57-165c98b1aa55` |
| **External TestFlight group ID** | `03dff58c-e0bd-4276-b720-5fcd9dfde010` |

---

## 3. API Keys

| Service | Key | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Groq** | `[GROQ_KEY — stored in GitHub Secret GROQ_API_KEY]` | Free tier, replaces Anthropic — zero user cost |
| **Groq model** | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` | Set in Config.swift + GitHub Secrets |
| **ElevenLabs** | `[ELEVENLABS_KEY — stored in GitHub Secret ELEVENLABS_API_KEY]` | |
| **ElevenLabs Voice ID** | `onwK4e9ZLuTAKqWW03F9` | Daniel, British male |

---

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Workflow file** | `/.github/workflows/build.yml` (repo root) |
| **Runner** | `macos-15`, `Xcode_26.3.app` |
| **Fastfile location** | `donsnotes-ios/MinimalProject/fastlane/Fastfile` |
| **Upload lane name** | `beta` (NOT `appstore` or `release` for TestFlight builds) |
| **App Store submit lane** | `release` — triggered by git tag `v*.*.*-release` only |
| **xcargs includes** | `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`, `GROQ_API_KEY` |
| **Trigger** | Push to `master` |
| **Build number** | Fastlane auto-increments CFBundleVersion from latest ASC build — git commit numbers and ASC numbers WILL diverge. This is normal. |

### Post-upload checklist — NOW FULLY AUTOMATED (Build 91+)
The Fastfile `beta` lane handles all post-upload steps automatically after every CI build:
1. Generates ASC JWT from GitHub Secrets (`APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID`, `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID`, `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY`) via PyJWT step in workflow
2. Polls ASC every 30s (up to 10 min) until build appears as `VALID`
3. `PATCH /v1/builds/{id}` → `usesNonExemptEncryption=false` (clears export compliance — 409=already set, that's fine)
4. `POST betaGroups/aca5f162.../relationships/builds` → internal group
5. `POST betaGroups/03dff58c.../relationships/builds` → external group

**No manual App Store Connect steps needed after a push. Fully hands-off.**

## 7. Critical Build Lessons (never repeat)

1. `Info.plist` uses `$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)` / `$(MARKETING_VERSION)` — NEVER hardcode
2. `SubscriptionService` must NOT be `@MainActor` — LUMENService reads from nonisolated context
3. `SpeechRecognizerService` owns AVAudioSession exclusively — category: `.playAndRecord`, mode: `.measurement`, options: `.duckOthers`
4. `removeTap(onBus: 0)` unconditional before `installTap`
5. `orbState = .listening` set BEFORE `speechService.startListening()`
6. **TimelineView `@ViewBuilder`: NO `let` bindings** — use OrbFrame struct
7. `.onChange(of:)` must use `{ _, newValue in }` syntax (Xcode 26)
8. Trigger word is `"ora"` (single word, lowercase)
9. Fastlane App Store lane is named `release` not `appstore`
10. Post-upload steps (export compliance + TestFlight groups) are now automated in the Fastfile beta lane — do NOT run manually
11. **Swift 6**: No `DispatchQueue.main.async` — use `Task { @MainActor in }` with `[weak self]` at closure start
12. When renaming enum cases, grep ALL files — sed misses model files
13. MockAPIService must implement ALL protocol methods or CI fails
14. **Icon files go in `Resources/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`** — NOT `Assets.xcassets/`
15. **One onboarding system only** — `DonsNotesApp` is the gate via `@AppStorage("hasSeenOnboarding")`
16. **Fastlane auto-increments CFBundleVersion from ASC** — git build numbers and ASC build numbers will diverge
17. User must delete + reinstall from TestFlight to get new icon (iOS icon cache doesn't update on OTA)
18. **Cellular call interruptions do NOT include `.shouldResume`** — `AVAudioSession.interruptionNotification` alone will never auto-resume after a phone call. Use `CTCallCenter.callEventHandler` for cellular call detection and recovery.
19. **`CTCallCenter.callEventHandler` fires on a background thread** — always dispatch to `@MainActor` via `Task { @MainActor in }` before touching any `@State` or UI.
20. **Post-upload pipeline is fully automated as of Build 91** — the Fastfile beta lane polls ASC, sets export compliance, and adds to both TestFlight groups. The workflow generates the ASC JWT via PyJWT from GitHub Secrets. No manual ASC steps ever needed again.

## 8. Known Bugs & Current Status

### Current build: 96

**Build 96 (July 13, 2026) — High-Value Feature Drop:**
- **Ask Ora (cross-meeting memory)** — Brain icon in toolbar opens `AskOraView`. Searches across all completed meetings using Groq llama-3.3-70b. Includes suggested prompts, conversation history, and per-turn answers. New file: `Sources/Views/AskOraView.swift`.
- **Pre-meeting brief** — When attendees are added (via quick-add, manual, or repeat meeting), Ora automatically looks up the most recent past meeting those attendees were in and shows a collapsible card with the date, summary snippet, and open action items. Updates live as attendees change.
- **Draft Follow-Up Email** — New "Draft Follow-Up Email" button (wand icon) in MeetingDetailView action buttons. Appears only when action items exist. Uses Groq to write a professional follow-up email (~200 words), then opens Mail/share sheet with To: pre-populated from attendee emails. Falls back to plain text share if Groq fails.

### Build 91
- **Phone call interruption** — Fixed in B91. CTCallCenter monitors cellular calls. Banner shown when call active. Auto-resumes 0.8s after call ends.
- **Silent fail on cellular calls** — Fixed in B91. Previously: iOS killed audio session with no user feedback. Now: banner + auto-resume.

### Fixed (history)
- Ora only answered once per session (alreadyTriggered never reset) — fixed B45
- App name showed "DonsNotes" in TestFlight — fixed B44 (PRODUCT_NAME=Ora)
- Groq free AI for all users — fixed B39
- Dev bypass for testing Pro features — fixed B34
- Crash after intro (duplicate onboarding) — fixed B48

## 12. User Preferences (critical — never violate)

- **Maximum automation** — "I want to make this as automated as possible so I only have to touch when absolutely necessary!!"
- **Never loop** — "Stop you're wasting all my coins" — find alternative immediately if something fails twice
- **No API key friction** — "So sick of API Bs!! Don't use I've wasted more $ and time on stupid api keys"
- **No Anthropic/paid AI on client** — "I don't want customers using my coins ever!!"
- **Agent makes decisions** — "You pick for what you need"
- **Test before sending** — "Take your time and test before sending"
- **No unrequested features** — "I didn't ask for that"
- **Quality bar is high** — "I want an out of the box app that blows people away"
- **Save state always** — "Save your spot to memory" — always save session state at end

## Build 100 — Blank recap after phone-call interruption (critical)

**Symptom:** Real user meeting had a phone call come in. User dismissed the call without answering. Recap email that arrived after the meeting was blank (headers only, no summary, no action items, no transcript).

**Root cause:** `SpeechRecognizerService.startListening()` unconditionally reset `fullTranscript = ""` and `transcript = ""` at the top of the function. When the CTCallCenter `.disconnected` handler called `startListening()` to auto-resume after a call, it wiped everything captured before the interruption. Same bug existed in the `.shouldResume` AVAudioSession path (Siri, alarms, AirPods).

**Fix:** Added a `resume: Bool = false` parameter to `startListening`. When true, skip the transcript wipe. Both interruption handlers in RecordingView.swift now call `startListening(resume: true)`. `beginRecording()` was already correct — it snapshots `fullTranscript` as `baseAtStart` and appends new segments, so preserving the buffer was the only missing piece.

**Also noted (not yet fixed):** `transcript_recovery.txt` is written every 30s during recording but nothing reads it back on next app launch. If iOS ever kills the app during a call, the user has no way to recover the captured transcript. Follow-up work: add a launch-time check that surfaces the recovery file to the user with a "restore this meeting" prompt.

**Marketing implication:** Build 91's release notes claimed transcript preservation across calls. That was aspirational, not real. Any TestFlight tester who took a call during a meeting since Build 91 shipped experienced silent transcript loss. Build 100 makes the Build 91 promise finally true — the Meet Ora launch was correctly held until this landed.

**Test before shipping:** Start a recording, speak for 30s, get someone to call you (or use Siri), dismiss the call, speak for another 30s, stop recording. Verify the recap email contains BOTH the pre-call and post-call content.
